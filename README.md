## Git Basics

The Git course on the Udacity platform is amazing, I definetely liked it. 
Concerning the learngitbranching.js.org, the 8th task in Remote: Push & Pull -- Git Remotes is poorly described. Despite the fact that I somehow managed to solve it, I'm not sure that I could understand the crux of the issue.
